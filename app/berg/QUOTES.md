## **Fashion Quote Usage Guidelines**

### **Tier Progression for Fashion Quotes**
- **Tier 3**: First fashion advice/outfit tips appear
- **Tier 4**: Full #berghainfits culture, shopping guides, anxiety
- **Tier 5**: Meta-commentary, commodification critique, influencer economy

### **Quote Triggers**
- **Capacity milestones**: Fashion anxiety quotes when crowds hit certain thresholds
- **Revenue goals**: Shopping/commercial quotes when money increases
- **Rejection events**: Post-rejection processing quotes after door policy tightens
- **Achievement unlocks**: Meta-commentary when reaching commercialization milestones

### **Mood Evolution for Fashion**
```javascript
const fashionMoodProgression = {
  tier3: ["advisory", "hopeful", "instructional"],
  tier4: ["anxious", "obsessive", "performative", "commercial"], 
  tier5: ["bitter", "sarcastic", "meta", "academic", "resigned"]
};
```

---

### **Progression Logic**
- **Tier 0**: Only show grateful, protective, educational quotes
- **Tier 1**: Mix of idealistic and early recognition quotes
- **Tier 2**: Add warning signs and commercial pressure quotes
- **Tier 3**: Introduce tourist invasion and displacement quotes
- **Tier 4**: Show identity crisis and commodification quotes
- **Tier 5**: Display systemic collapse and corporate culture quotes

### **Mood Evolution**
```javascript
const moodProgression = {
  tier0: ["grateful", "protective", "educational"],
  tier1: ["excited", "philosophical", "proud"], 
  tier2: ["observant", "concerned", "warning"],
  tier3: ["analytical", "frustrated", "bewildered"],
  tier4: ["critical", "resigned", "commercial"],
  tier5: ["defeated", "mourning", "philosophical", "statistical"]
};
```

### **Display Strategy**
- Show 1 new quote every 30-60 seconds of gameplay
- Weight quotes by tier (more from current tier, some from adjacent)

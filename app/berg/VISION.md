# BergInc: The Vision

*Capturing the artistic and cultural vision for Berghain Incremental*

## Core Artistic Vision

> "our techno game which is both a testament to a culture, and a nod to their online communities; a zeitgeist piece about the end of times and 'la fin des reperes', where we lose track of what we took for granted, what were guarantees"

> "a piece which is also foremost a visual game, with a clear aesthetic, soft blurs and dark angles, concrete vibrating and pulsing as the basses thomp, the people mingling and moving and dancing and fucking and changing and the social fabric being interwoven and torn apart and changed and rewritten every week-end as each new KlubNacht wonders: will it be the last?"

## Design Philosophy

> "Capture what I just wrote as guiding light for our style"

> "You focus on aesthetic and quality over completion: the goal is a solid engaging basis that we can deploy in 2 hours after a solid iteration together"

## Movement Evolution (Key Addition)

> "We should also have the movements go from mostly synchronised, collective transe, to mostly individualistic, lone trajectories. That is part of the vision"

## Cultural Commentary Themes

### The End of Guarantees
- What was once stable becomes uncertain
- Every KlubNacht carries existential weight
- The question "will it be the last?" haunts every experience

### Social Fabric Transformation
- Community bonds that are "interwoven and torn apart and changed and rewritten" 
- Collective experience fragmenting into individual performance
- The dance floor as metaphor for society

### Movement as Metaphor
- **Early Tiers**: Synchronized collective trance - people moving together as one organism
- **Later Tiers**: Individualistic lone trajectories - isolated movement patterns, selfie spots, performative dancing
- The evolution from communion to consumption

## Visual Language

### Aesthetics
- "soft blurs and dark angles"
- "concrete vibrating and pulsing as the basses thump"
- Evolution from authentic underground to polished commercial

### Interaction Design
- "clear aesthetic" 
- Quality over quantity
- Every visual element should support the emotional journey

## Technical Vision

### Performance
- Smooth, hypnotic movement simulation
- 60fps crowd simulation as part of the art
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Integration
- Leverages existing incr factory framework
- 2-hour iteration to deployment pipeline
- Focus on solid, engaging foundation

## Emotional Arc

The game should make players feel:
1. **Wonder** - Initial appreciation for the underground culture
2. **Temptation** - Seductive growth mechanics
3. **Complicity** - Realization of their role in transformation
4. **Loss** - Mourning for what was destroyed
5. **Reflection** - Understanding of cultural forces at play

## Naming Philosophy

> "BergInc is a play on BergIncremental but also BergIncorporated - make this subtly transpire"

The title itself embodies the transformation:
- **Early tiers**: Feels like "Berg Incremental" - a game about gradual growth
- **Later tiers**: Reveals itself as "Berg Incorporated" - corporate takeover complete
- The double meaning should subtly emerge through typography, UI elements, and context

*This is not just a game about a club - it's about how capitalism transforms everything it touches, including the spaces that initially resist it.*
